# Employee Salary Prediction- Ujjwal

🧠 Employee Salary Prediction using Machine Learning & Streamlit
This project uses machine learning to predict employee salaries based on various features such as experience, education, job role, and location. The model is trained in Python and deployed through an interactive Streamlit web application.

📌 Overview
Predicting employee salary is useful for HR analytics, compensation planning, and job market analysis. In this project, we build and deploy a machine learning model that estimates salary based on input features.

The app allows users to enter data such as years of experience, education level, job title, and more — and receive a predicted salary instantly.

🎯 Key Features
Clean and preprocess employee data

Train regression models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Evaluate model performance using metrics (MAE, RMSE, R²)

Build an interactive web UI with Streamlit

Predict salaries in real-time based on user input

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python

Streamlit (for web UI)

Scikit-learn (for model training)

Pandas, NumPy (for data manipulation)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)

📈 Future Improvements
Add more detailed feature engineering (e.g., skills, certifications)

Use more advanced models (e.g., XGBoost)

Connect to live job data APIs

Deploy on cloud (Streamlit Cloud, AWS, etc.)
